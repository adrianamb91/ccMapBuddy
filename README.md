# ccMapBuddy
There are several projects here:
The Tiger project is the server project that is working and is deployed at http://1-dot-tiger-cc.appspot.com/ 
The SiberianTiger project and SiberianTiger-AppEngine are an Android application and a GAE backend application that communicate with each other, but I haven't been able to integrate the Google Maps API within the SiberianTiger Android application. 
The Android-Maps Tiger application is an Android application that uses the Google Maps API. 
If I were to merge all these project, probably I would get most of the implementation done, but I haven't been able to pass the configurations step for the merging to work.
